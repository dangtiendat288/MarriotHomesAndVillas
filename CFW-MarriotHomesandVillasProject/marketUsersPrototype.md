*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

These websites are relevant comparisons because they cater to guests searching for temporary accommodation options, including whole-home rentals. Vrbo focuses on vacation homes and entire properties, while Booking.com offers diverse lodging types, from hotels to apartments. Hometogo aggregates listings from various rental sites to provide extensive options. Each platform demonstrates industry best practices in serving guests through user-friendly design and comprehensive features tailored to enhancing the booking experience.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that while Marriott's Homes and Villas program appeals to users with its promise of high-quality, worry-free stays, there is a disconnect between users' exploratory needs and the website's current functionality. Quantitative data shows that 75.79% of users are undecided on a specific destination, aligning with qualitative feedback where users express frustration with the lack of tools for discovering activities and attractions in a location. Users seek an intuitive, visually appealing experience that emphasizes local experiences and things to do in a city rather than focusing solely on property amenities, simplifying vacation planning for varied preferences.
